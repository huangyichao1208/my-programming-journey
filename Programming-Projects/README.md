# My Programming Projects

Welcome to the **Programming-Projects** repository! This is a collection of various coding projects I've built as part of my learning journey.

Each project is stored in its own dedicated folder. Inside each project folder, you'll find a **`README.md`** file with more details, including:

* **Visuals:** Screenshots or GIFs of the project's output.
* **Setup Instructions:** A guide on how to run the code on a Mac.

Feel free to explore and check out the code.
